 "Calculator" React application using react cra library .
with all the components must be "function" components and all the code inside the components should be optimized and memorized using hooks (as much as possible).
This application should only allow user to do addition and subtraction.
The app should have a Redux store (please use redux toolkit library Redux Toolkit | Redux Toolkit (redux-toolkit.js.org)) that mantains the history of all the calculations with their results.
This history is also displayed on the screen at the botton of the page, and it's refreshed with any new result the user input.
